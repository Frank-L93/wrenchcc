## 👋 About Wrench.CC

Tired of using messy spreadsheets (or your own memory 🧠) to track your bike maintenance? Ever wondered exactly how many kilometers are on that chain? Wrench.CC is a web application built for cyclists who love their gear and want to keep it in prime condition.

This project, built by [Frank Lambregts](https://github.com/Frank-L93), aims to be the go-to app for:

-   🚲 **Bike & Component Management:** Add all your bikes and the components on them.
-   📈 **Usage Tracking:** Log rides to see how much wear and tear your parts have.
-   🛠️ **Maintenance Log:** Keep a detailed history of every service, from a simple wash to a full rebuild.
-   🔔 **Service Reminders:** (Future goal!) Get notified when a component is due for maintenance.

## ✨ Features

-   **Sleek & Modern UI:** A clean interface with a beautiful standard **dark mode** 🌙.
-   **Component-Driven:** Built with a `Flux` Blade component library for consistency.
-   **Interactive Frontend:** Powered by Laravel Livewire for a fast, single-page-app feel without the complexity.
